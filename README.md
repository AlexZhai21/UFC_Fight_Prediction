# UFC_Fight_Prediction
This is a personal project of models used for predicting the results of UFC Fights (without betting odds, using only stat data and career data only). It contains the code I used to scrape the data, engineer features and build the model.
This was all coded in JupyterNotebooks, so code must be ran in Jupyter Notebook.
The project is still in progress. Eventually, I plan to deploy the model and launch a website for everyone to use.
